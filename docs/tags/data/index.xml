      <description>To assess the potential impact of variants (SNV, SVs) we might want to use some of the public epigentic datasets. The amount and heterogeneity of this data is a bit overwhelming. I would like to get a summary of which regions of the genome are the most functionally important.
The plan is to:
 get annotated peaks for the 6 typical histone marks in 5-6 tissues, merging sub-tissues (e.g.Â brain subregions) keep regions supported by enough replicates  Eventually, I could also annotate the regions that are tissue-specific or shared across tissues.</description>
