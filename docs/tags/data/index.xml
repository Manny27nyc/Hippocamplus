      <description>Candidate Cancer Gene Database (CCGD) Cancer Gene Census Merge the gene lists “Effect” vs “Role” ?  Known CNA hotspots Saving the R objects   This is an updated version of an old private post where I had prepared some R objects with cancer genes and CNA hotspots. I used this to quickly annotate copy number results in cancer projects. The file was almost 3 years old so here is an updated version (as of today, Apr 3 2019).</description>

      <description>To assess the potential impact of variants (SNV, SVs) we might want to use some of the public epigentic datasets. The amount and heterogeneity of this data is a bit overwhelming. I would like to get a summary of which regions of the genome are the most functionally important.
The plan is to:
 get annotated peaks for the 6 typical histone marks in 5-6 tissues, merging sub-tissues (e.g. brain subregions) keep regions supported by enough replicates  Eventually, I could also annotate the regions that are tissue-specific or shared across tissues.</description>
