      <description>I have another website where I write down my reviews of the papers I read. To handle citations in pages and posts, I was originally using jekyll-scholar. It scales well enough that I could have one main BibTeX file for all the pages of the website. I’m now switching to blogdown/Hugo because it’s apparently faster, with less dependencies, but most importantly because it’s very easy to integrate R code with RMarkdown.</description>
