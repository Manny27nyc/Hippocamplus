      <description>Testing if two sets of genomic regions overlap significantly is not straightforward. In the simple situation of regions of 1 bp (e.g. SNVs) we could use a hypergeometric test. When the regions are small enough and there are not too many, the hypergeometric test might also be a fair approximation.
But when we manipulate many regions of variable size covering the entire genome it’s not as straightforward. The gene annotation is an example.</description>

      <description>Segmental Duplications (SD) I downloaded the segmental duplication annotation for hg19 from UCSC. There are 51599 annotated SD. They are defined as regions larger than 1 Kbp with at least 90% similarity with another region in the genome.
 Segmental duplication regions Many SD are nested of located next to each other. I merge overlapping SDs (or located at &amp;lt;10 bp) to create SD regions, i.e. longer stretch of the genome overlapping SDs.</description>

      <description>To assess the potential impact of variants (SNV, SVs) we might want to use some of the public epigentic datasets. The amount and heterogeneity of this data is a bit overwhelming. I would like to get a summary of which regions of the genome are the most functionally important.
The plan is to:
 get annotated peaks for the 6 typical histone marks in 5-6 tissues, merging sub-tissues (e.g. brain subregions) keep regions supported by enough replicates  Eventually, I could also annotate the regions that are tissue-specific or shared across tissues.</description>

      <description>Gencode v19 I downloaded Gencode v19 at ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/gencode/Gencode_human/release_19/gencode.v19.annotation.gtf.gz.
 Genes Number Focusing on autosomes/X/Y, there are 57,783 “genes” of different types:
I merge the rare types into a other class and some RNAs.

      <description>Mappability track I produced a mappability track from the UCSC track. The raw file contains, for each base in the genome, an estimation of the probability that a read is correctly mapped at this position.
Using a sliding-window approach, I compute the average mappability in regions of size 1 Kbp. This is a more manageable amount of data and still informative, especially when interested in large regions (e.g. SVs).
I used a custom Perl script to efficiently parse the bedGraph-transformed original file.</description>
