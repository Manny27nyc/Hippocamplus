      <description>A few month ago, a short paper was published in Nature Biotechnology1 about the mental health crisis in science. It attracted a bit of attention on the news and social media, which is good because itâ€™s an important matter. The article was very good at putting the subject on the table and proposing some solutions, but it picked my curiosity about nonresponse bias.
Issues with the Nature Biotech article The numbers are based on an email survey so one issue is the nonresponse bias: the individuals that responded might not be representative of the population.</description>
