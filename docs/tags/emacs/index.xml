      <description>I recently started working with WDL files. The Broad Institute recommends using Sublime and the syntax highlighter that they provide. They also provide a syntax highlighter for Vim.
I started by looking for a solution in Emacs, my go-to editor. Luckily there was already a WDL mode available that I just slightly improved. I also made a polymode to complement it. Both are available through MELPA as wdl-mode and poly-mode.</description>
