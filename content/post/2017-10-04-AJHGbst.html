<p>I couldn’t find an up-to-date/working <strong>LaTeX bibliography style for the American Journal of Human Genetics (AJHG)</strong>. The output from <code>unsrtnat</code> (my goto style) was also quite different from what the journal wanted.</p>
<p>I found a bibliography style for <em>Cell</em> which is almost what AJHG wants, but I also wanted the references to be <strong>ordered by their appearance in the text</strong> (like for <code>unsrtnat</code>) and not alphabetically. So I downloaded both <code>cell.bst</code> (<a href="https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cell">here</a>) and <code>unsrtnat.bst</code> (<a href="https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/">here</a>) files and merged them. I don’t understand all the details but after some trial-and-errors it seems to work.</p>
<p>After merging, I removed the <em>emphasis</em> on the Journal/Book name which was the only difference I could see between the Cell and AJHG styles.</p>
<p>I also added some code to <strong>automatically compress long author lists</strong> into “<em>et al.</em>”. In the code, the line with <code>max.num.names.before.forced.et.al</code> specifies the maximum number of authors before switching to “<em>et al.</em>”. The line with <code>num.names.shown.with.forced.et.al</code> specifies how many authors to show when using <em>et al.</em>. They are both set at 10, following AJHG guidelines.</p>
<p>The final <code>ajhg.bst</code> file can be found <a href="https://github.com/jmonlong/Hippocamplus/blob/config/LaTeX/ajhg.bst">here</a>. I used it with <code>\usepackage[comma,super]{natbib}</code>.</p>
