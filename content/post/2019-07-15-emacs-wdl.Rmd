I recently started working with [WDL](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/documentation/) files.
The Broad Institute recommends using Sublime and the [syntax highlighter](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl-sublime-syntax-highlighter) that they provide.
They also provide a [syntax highlighter for Vim](https://github.com/broadinstitute/vim-wdl).
[As Denis Loginov mentioned](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/pull/321#issuecomment-511617350), they are working on an LSP implementation for WDL that could be use by Emacs to get syntax validation.

I looked first for a **solution in Emacs**, my go-to editor.
Luckily there was already a WDL mode available that I just slightly improved.
I also made a polymode to complement it and configured *lsp-mode* to use the WDL implementation.
All packages are available through [MELPA](https://github.com/melpa/melpa) as `wdl-mode`, `poly-mode`, `lsp-mode`.

Other useful commands include `(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)` and the `whitespace-mode` to ensure consistent indents (see the [WDL section of my Emacs page](/emacs#for-wdl-workflows)).

## wdl-mode

The [wdl-mode package](https://github.com/zhanxw/wdl-mode) provides **syntax highlighting and indentation**.
It was developed by [Xiaowei Zhan](https://github.com/zhanxw).

I noticed that the indentation was not triggered in the presence of space(s) after the character that should trigger it (`{`, `<<<`, `}`, `>>>`).
Maybe this space is not supposed to be there in the first place.
Still, some the files I was working with (or some of [TOPMed's workflows](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/topmed-workflows/blob/master/variant-caller/variant-caller-wdl/topmed_freeze3_calling.wdl)) had those sometimes.
I think it's worth catching those, so I modified the package.
It's now a [PR in the main repo](https://github.com/zhanxw/wdl-mode/pull/3).
If it's not merged and part of the next version on MELPA, it could always be modified locally (e.g. in the `.emacs.d/elpa/wdl-mode*/wdl-mode.el`).

## poly-mode

Starting from existing polymodes, I wrote one for WDL. 
The goal was to **automatically switch to "*shell mode*" in the command chunks**, mostly to get the appropriate indentation.
The [poly-wdl package](https://github.com/jmonlong/poly-wdl) is now in MELPA and I'm glad I got to contribute to MELPA even if just with a simple and field-specific package.

## Language Server Protocol

There is an [LSP implementation for WDL](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl-ide) that can be used by Emacs to provide **syntax validation and (some) auto-completion**.
It's still under active development but it seems to work well already.

To use it in Emacs, the python package providing the server needs to be installed first and Emacs' *lsp-mode* needs to be configured:

- Install the [LSP server for WDL](https://pypi.org/project/wdl-lsp/): `pip install wdl-lsp` (or `pip3`).
- Install packages through MELPA: `lsp-mode`, `lsp-ui` and `company-lsp`.
- Add to `.emacs` file:

~~~lisp
(require 'lsp-mode)
(add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(wdl-mode . "wdl"))
(defgroup lsp-wdl nil
  "LSP support for WDL."
  :group 'lsp-mode
  :link '(url-link "https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl-ide"))
(defcustom lsp-wdl-server-command "wdl-lsp"
  "Command to start wdl-lsp."
  :group 'lsp-wdl
  :risky t
  :type 'file)
(lsp-register-client
 (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection
                                   (lambda () lsp-wdl-server-command))
                  :major-modes '(wdl-mode)
                  :priority -1
                  :server-id 'wdl))
(add-hook 'wdl-mode-hook #'lsp)
;; Syntax validation interface
(require 'lsp-ui)
(add-hook 'lsp-mode-hook 'lsp-ui-mode)
(setq lsp-ui-sideline-enable nil)
;; To get some auto-completion
(require 'company-lsp)
(push 'company-lsp company-backends)
~~~

Note: The first time a file is opened, the package will ask what is the root of the project.
I use the folder that contains the WDL file because I don't think project structures are integrated at this point.
This can be changed at any time using `M-x lsp-workspace-folders-remove` and `M-x lsp-workspace-folders-add`.

Here is an example of part of a TOPMed workflow for read alignment [available here](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/topmed-workflows/blob/master/aligner/u_of_michigan_aligner/u_of_michigan_aligner.wdl).
