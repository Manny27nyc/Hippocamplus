<p>Christmas is coming.
DNA tests are cool gifts but I’ve already offered it to some members of my family before.
Now I was wondering if I could use this data in a more creative way and produce some kind of artistic representation of the DNA data to give them for Christmas.
Some kind of DNA art or painting that would be unique for each person.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, I didn’t find much on the internet for something like this.
I expected some people to have already tried considering the success of 23andme and co.
<a href="https://www.dotone.io/">One company</a> sells scarves made from some selected variants with associated traits (eye color, etc).
Others were just printing <a href="https://www.dna11.com/dna-images-gallery">photos of gels</a>.</p>
<p>So I started tinkering a script around a year ago and now it feel like a good time to stop and put it out there.
First, I’m running out of inspiration.
And then I used the script a couple of month ago for a friend’s birthday present and I think it turned out OK, so here it is, my attempt at DNA art…</p>
<hr />
<p>After some feedback from friends, I ended up implementing a <strong>four different versions</strong>: tree, weave, noise, and stars.
Every time, the DNA is used to create a background or some kind of mesh that, by itself, is not that amazing but could be combined with some photo edition to create cool images.</p>
<div id="version-1-tree" class="section level2">
<h2>Version 1: Tree</h2>
<p>The first idea was to represent how unique is the person.
Each fork represents a mutation with three “options”: homozygous for the common allele, heterozygous, or homozygous for the rare allele.
The real tree would be huge and this version represents just the branch/path followed by that person.
The image would be unique because the “chances” to go though the same path (same choices at each fork) are extremely low.
At least that’s what I wanted to depict.</p>
<p>CARTOON</p>
<p>EXAMPLE</p>
</div>
<div id="version-2-weave" class="section level2">
<h2>Version 2: Weave</h2>
<p>Very similar to version 1 but with a thicker path/fork so that it covers more surface.
This is better suited to use as a mask for a photo, while the first version worked mostly when combining with simple “texture” images.</p>
<p>CARTOON</p>
<p>EXAMPLE</p>
</div>
<div id="version-3-noise" class="section level2">
<h2>Version 3: Noise</h2>
<p>Here the goal was to create some kind of pixel noise based on the DNA and see if larger patterns would arise.
Each variant is represented as a pixel whose size depends on the genotype: no pixel if homozygous for the common allele; small pixel if heterozygous; large pixel if homozygous for the rare allele.</p>
<p>CARTOON</p>
<p>EXAMPLE</p>
</div>
<div id="version-4-stars" class="section level2">
<h2>Version 4: Stars</h2>
<p>Finally, each variant are represented as points whose size depends on the genotype.
Similar to the previous version: no point if homozygous for the common allele; small point if heterozygous; large point if homozygous for the rare allele.
We can then make these points look like stars and combine with some other space images.</p>
<p>CARTOON</p>
<p>EXAMPLE</p>
</div>
<div id="notes" class="section level2">
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>In the end there are so many variants that it’s impossible to see if we use all of them and print on a reasonable surface (having an entire wall covered with this would cool though).
My solution was to pack variants and represent these packs with a special symbol.</p>
<p>CARTOON</p>
<p>We could imagine these packs as nucleosomes, the DNA packing system.
It could be something more poetic like galaxies in the stars representation, or the tree branch looping in a third dimension for version 1.</p>
<hr />
<p>To make the meaning more significant, I used the frequency of the variant in the 1000GP to find out which allele is common vs rare. I like the idea of the brighter stars representing rare things about the person.</p>

<p>A couple of example of each version (from random data):</p>
