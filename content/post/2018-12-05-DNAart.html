<p>Christmas is coming. DNA tests are cool gifts but I’ve already offered it to some members of my family before. Now I was wondering if I could use this data in a more creative way and produce some kind of artistic representation of the DNA data to give them for Christmas. Some kind of DNA art or painting that would be unique.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, I didn’t find much on the internet for something like this. I expected some people to have already tried considering the success of 23andMe, Ancestry etc. <a href="https://www.dotone.io/">One company</a> sells scarves with motives generated from selected variants with associated traits (eye color, etc). Others were just printing <a href="https://www.dna11.com/dna-images-gallery">photos of gels</a>.</p>
<p>So I started tinkering a script around a year ago and now it feel like a good time to stop and put it out there. First, I’ve long passed the peak of excitement/inspiration. And second, I used the script a couple of month ago for a friend’s birthday present and I think it turned out OK. So here it is, my attempt at DNA art…</p>
<hr />
<p>After getting some feedback from friends, I ended up implementing <strong>four different versions</strong>: tree, weave, noise, and stars. Each time, the DNA is used to create a background or some kind of mesh that, by itself, is not that amazing but could be combined with some photo edition to create cool images.</p>
<div id="version-1-tree" class="section level2">
<h2>Version 1: Tree</h2>
<p>The first idea was to represent how unique is the person. Each fork represents a mutation with three “options”: homozygous for the common allele, heterozygous, or homozygous for the rare allele. The complete tree would be huge and this version represents just the branch/path followed by that person. The image is unique because the “chances” to go though the same path (same choices at each fork) are extremely low. At least that’s what I wanted to communicate.</p>

<div id="version-2-weave" class="section level2">
<h2>Version 2: Weave</h2>
<p>Very similar to version 1 but with a thicker path/fork so that it covers more surface. This is better suited to use as a mask for a photo, while the first version worked mostly when combining with simple “texture” images.</p>

<div id="version-3-noise" class="section level2">
<h2>Version 3: Noise</h2>
<p>Here the goal was to create some kind of pixel noise based on the DNA data and see if larger patterns would arise. Each variant is represented as a pixel whose size depends on the genotype: no pixel if homozygous for the common allele; small pixel if heterozygous; large pixel if homozygous for the rare allele.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="version-4-stars" class="section level2">
<h2>Version 4: Stars</h2>
<p>Finally, variants are represented as points whose size depends on the genotype. Similar to the previous version: no point if homozygous for the common allele; small point if heterozygous; large point if homozygous for the rare allele. We can then make these points look like stars and combine with some other space images.</p>

<h2>Gallery</h2>
<p>A couple of example of each version (or see <a href="https://flic.kr/s/aHskKjn4w6">album on Flickr</a>) :</p>

<div id="notes" class="section level2">
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>I didn’t think about that at first but there are so many variants that we don’t see much if we use all of them and print on a reasonable surface (having an entire wall covered with this would cool though). My solution was to pack variants and represent these packs with a special symbol. For example, draw 200 variants, then pack the next 10K, draw 200 variants, …</p>

</div>
<p>We could imagine these packs as nucleosomes, the DNA packing system. It could also be something more poetic like galaxies in the stars representation, or imagining the tree branch looping in a third dimension for version 1.</p>
<hr />
<p>I used the frequency of the variant in the 1000GP to find out which allele is common vs rare. I like the idea of the brighter stars representing rare things about the person.</p>
