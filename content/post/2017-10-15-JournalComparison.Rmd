- Impact Factor for 2016/2017 from [bioxbio](http://www.bioxbio.com/if/).
- APC from [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/).
- *Received-to-accepted time* and *Pub/year* based on all articles published in 2016. `~` means that it's based on a subset of the publications (~200).

Todo:

- Add publication fee.
- Maybe I could rank the journals for each column and compute a master rank.
- More journals.
- Show fees in USD for all.

## "Good" ones:

- [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/) is non-profit, open and more modern.
- [PLOS](https://www.plos.org/which-journal-is-right-for-me) the pioneer in open-access.
- [BMC](http://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals#journallist), although it's owned by Springer Nature publishing group.
- [F1000](https://f1000research.com/) where the manuscript is "published" right away and then transparently peer-reviewed. Once PR, it is indexed in PubMed etc.
- [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/) is about open-access and cost-efficient publishing.

## "Evil" publishing companies

- Elsevier.
- Springer Nature.
