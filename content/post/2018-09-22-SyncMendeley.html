<p>Recently, I’ve been setting up new computers from scratch as I moved from Montreal to Santa Cruz. Like for spring cleaning, it might be a good idea to clarify the system I’ve been using to manage bibliography and PDF annotation.</p>
<p>Briefly I use Mendeley Desktop and also put all PDF files in a Google Drive. Both are synced with my Android tablet. On the tablet, I use the Mendeley app to get information, search etc, but I read/annotate the PDFs from the Google Drive. On a computer I use a custom Python script to update the PDFs if necessary.</p>
<div id="the-updatemendeley.py-script" class="section level2">
<h2>The <code>updateMendeley.py</code> script</h2>
<p>I wrote a Python script that checks the Google Drive folder and Mendeley’s local folder, matches PDF files and syncs them. The <code>updateMendeley.py</code> script is on <a href="https://github.com/jmonlong/Hippocamplus/tree/config/python/updateMendeley">the GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>I needed something slightly better than a <code>rsync</code> because it’s possible that the filenames are not the same between the two folders. This might not be a big problem for new files but at some point Mendeley Desktop and the app I used on the tablet produced slightly different file names for the same article. I don’t use the Android app to download PDFs anymore but I still have old PDFs that I didn’t take the time to rename.</p>
<p>The <em>matching</em> part of the script compares each file name in the Google Drive with the file names in the local Mendeley folder. It uses the <em>SequenceMatcher</em> function from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html">difflib</a> module. If two file names have more than 90% match, it assumes that it’s the same article. The result of the matching step is saved locally in a “cache” file to speed up future runs.</p>
<p>Then it’s just a question of copying the new articles to the Google Drive or updating the local Mendeley folder (if files have different sizes).</p>
<p>In practice, I run the following command when I feel a sync is needed (first a dry run, then without the <code>-dry</code>):</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>python updateMendeley.py -local PATH/TO/MendeleyDesktop -remote PATH/TO/GoogleDrive/ArticlesPDF -dry</code></pre>

<h2>Why Mendeley?</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>That’s what I started using a while ago (before Elsevier acquired it).</li>
<li>It has an Android app (I have an Android tablet).</li>
<li>It does what I need: tagging system, export to BibTeX, search in PDFs, online portal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe I could find a good system with EndNote or Zotero but that would take some time and work. The idea of Zotero is appealing and I would prefer an open-source software (not owned by Elsevier). I tried to make the switch but it froze when importing my entire library. I should try again. There is still the problem of the Android app: I don’t know what they are worth for Zotero. There are two unofficial apps. Maybe I could pay the $2 and test them.</p>

<div id="why-not-use-the-pdf-syncing-mechanism-from-mendeley" class="section level2">
<h2>Why not use the PDF syncing mechanism from Mendeley?</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Google Drive is more user-friendly: quickly access from different devices, easy to share PDF with others.</li>
<li>Control over the files.</li>
<li>Easy to update PDFs annotated on the tablet. Useful because I prefer to use a separate Android application to annotate PDFs (RepliGo).</li>
<li>Bad experience this summer with <a href="https://blog.mendeley.com/2018/06/01/support-update-pdfs-missing-from-desktop-and-web-library/">a bug in Mendeley</a> (blocked for more than a month and lost many PDFs, some of which were annotated).</li>

<h2>Syncing the Google Drive folder</h2>
<ul>
<li>On Android I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.lite&amp;hl=en_US">FolderSync</a>.</li>
<li>On Ubuntu I use <a href="/internet#sync-a-specific-google-drive-folder-on-ubuntu">grive</a>.</li>
<li>On OSX I use the official Google Drive app: <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download/">Backup and Sync</a>.</li>
