<p>I have another website where I write down my reviews of the papers I read.
To handle citations in pages and posts, I was originally using <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar">jekyll-scholar</a>.
It scales well enough that I could have <strong>one main BibTeX file for all the pages</strong> of the website.
I’m now switching to <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>/<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> because it’s apparently faster, with less dependencies, but most importantly because it’s very easy to integrate R code with RMarkdown.
To use citations in blogdown, we can specify the BibTeX file in the YAML header and then use either <code>@blabla</code> or <code>[@blabla]</code> in the text (for multiple citations: <code>[@blabla;@foo]</code>).
In the YAML header:</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>bibliography: [../../static/library.bib]
link-citations: true</code></pre>
<p>It seemed to work well at first but after adding more pages <strong>the rendering got stuck</strong>.
Googling around, it seemed to be a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16223019/pandoc-performs-very-slowly-when-referencing-large-biblatex-file">known issue for pandoc-citation and large bibliography</a>, the solution being to use a bib file as small as possible by keeping only the records cited.
Surprisingly this didn’t fix my problem and now even with a tiny BibTeX file I couldn’t render some pages.
It turned out that <strong>the problem was the very long author list</strong> in some citations, which is common in the genomics field.
So the solution for me was to keep only the records cited AND set a maximum number of authors.</p>
<p>I wrote a small <strong>Python script</strong> that scans Markdown files for citations and extract them from a BibTeX file, shortening the author list if necessary.
I put the <code>reduceBib.py</code> Python script <a href="https://github.com/jmonlong/Hippocamplus/tree/config/python/reduceBib">on GitHub here</a>.</p>
<div id="reducebib.py-usage" class="section level2">
<h2><code>reduceBib.py</code> usage</h2>
<p>At the root of the website, I use the following command:</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>python reduceBib.py -b static/library.bib -o static/library-small.bib content/fixed/*.Rmd content/post/*.Rmd</code></pre>
<p>The help page:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; python reduceBib.py -h
usage: reduceBib.py [-h] [-b BIB] [-o OUT] [-a NAUTHS] [-f FIELDS]
                    mds [mds ...]
