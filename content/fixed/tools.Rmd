## Git

+ Commit all modification and added files: `git commit -am "informative message"`
+ To show all the history of a file: `git log -p -- file`
+ To retrieve a specific version of a file: `git show COMMIT:file`
+ Revert repo to a specific commit: `git checkout COMMIT`
+ Undo a commit: `git reset HEAD~` and then for the real commit `git commit -c ORIG_HEAD`.
+ Update sub-modules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
+ Add all untracked files: `git st -s | grep '??' | cut -f2 -d ' ' | xargs git add`
+ Add remote e.g. after a fork: `git remote add mine git@github.com:jmonlong/REPO.git`

#### Aliases

~~~sh
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global user.email '<EMAIL>'
git config --global user.name 'Jean Monlong'
~~~

#### Branches

+ List branches: `git branch`
+ List all branches: `git branch -a`
+ Update remote branch list: `git remote prune origin`
+ Create branch: `git checkout -b hotfix`
+ Link it to a remote branch: `git branch -u origin/hotflix`
+ Creat a new local branch from remote: `git co -t origin/hotfix`
+ Merge the current branch with another branch: `git merge hotfix`
+ Delete a branch: `git branch -d hotfix`
+ Delete remote branch: `git push origin :hotfix`


#### Check status of all repos

I have an alias calling the following commands:

~~~sh
WD=`pwd`
for ff in `find . -maxdepth 5 -name .git`
do
    GDIR=`dirname $ff`
    echo $GDIR
    cd $WD/$GDIR
    git st -s
    git st | grep ahead
done
cd $WD
~~~

## Snakemake

- [Documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io)

A few trick I'd like to remember or try soon:

- Double "{{"/"}}" to escape `{` `}` in *expand* or NOT to define wildcards.
- Define regexp constraints on wildcards as `{data,\d+}` or using *wildcard_constraints* (within a rule or globally).
- Passing a Python/R *script:* directly.
- Output file marked as `temp()` are deleted when not needed by any rules anymore.
- Output file marked as `touch()` for flag files.
- Local rules when running on a HPC.
- Use remote (S3) files with `remote()`

[Configuration files](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/configuration.html#configuration) used as `config["samples"]`.
Can also be used as `snakemake --config yourparam=1.5`.
For sample metadata, a [tabular configuration](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/configuration.html#tabular-configuration) can also be used using Pandas.
It's also possible to define a separate config file for the cluster configuration (e.g. resources for each rule).


## jq

[Lesson at programminghistorian.org](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/json-and-jq)

- Select elements based on one field's value: `jq 'select(.field==value)'`
- Keep only desired fields: `jq '{id: .id, title: .title}'`
- Write in TSV: `jq '.array | @tsv'`

## vd

[vd](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata) can read many file formats, including TSV, CSV, JSON. 
I use it to explore TSV files as a more powerful *less*.
It's great to format wide columns but also to quickly explore summary stats of the table.

Keybindings:

- `Ctr-H` or `z?` triggers the help page
- `_` expand/contract column.
- `z_ <N>` set current column width to *N*.
- `/` regex search in current column
- `g/` regex search in all columns
- `n`/`N` move to next/previous match
- `[`/`]` sort ascending/descending by current column
- `F` toggle a frequency table/histogram of the current column.
    - `Enter` to focus on a subset defined by a row in frequency table.
- `I` toggle Describe sheet with summary statistics for each column.
- `.` toggle dot plot. 
    - Make sure to set a column as numeric with `#`. 
    - Eventually select x-axis or labels with `!` first.

## rsync

`rsync` is not completely intuitive to me. 
Here are some of the commands I could make work.

--- 

To recurrently sync all the files that match the patterns in `rsyncIncludes.txt`:

~~~sh
rsync -r --include='*/' --include-from=rsyncIncludes.txt --exclude='*' --prune-empty-dirs SRC DEST
~~~

---

To recurrently sync all the files that match the patterns in `rsyncIncludes.txt` EXCEPT some with a specific pattern.
Practical example: all the R scripts but not the ones created by BatchJobs in `*-files` directories:

~~~sh
rsync -r --exclude="*-files" --include='*/' --include='*.R' --exclude='*' --prune-empty-dirs SRC DEST
~~~


## Docker

I'm still learning Docker but here are commands/parameters that seem relevant for me:

#### Build a docker instance

[Write a Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/) :

+ `WORKDIR /root` sets the working directory.
+ `COPY PopSV_1.0.tar.gz ./` copies a file in the instance. The `/` is important !
+ There is a cache management system so it's important to keep related commands in the same `RUN`.

To run in the folder with the `Dockerfile`.

~~~sh
docker build -t jmonlong/popsv-docker .
~~~

Ignore (big) files fro the build context using a `.dockerignore` file.

#### Launch a docker instance

To launch an interactive instance with a shared folder:

~~~sh
docker run -t -i -v /home/ubuntu/analysis1:/root/analysis1 jmonlong/popsv-docker
~~~

+ `-t` and `-i` are used for interactive run.
+ `-v` links folder in the host with folder in the image. It must be **absolute paths**.
+ Sometimes use `bash` as the command to force interactive, or `--entrypoint /bin/bash` if the image uses an *ENTRYPOINT*.
+ To make sure the files created by the container have the appropriate owner use: `` -u `id -u $USER` ``.

#### Increase memory

In Mac OS, I had some problems with the docker stopping because of memory issues.
I fixed by changing:

~~~sh
docker-machine stop
VBoxManage modifyvm default --cpus 3
VBoxManage modifyvm default --memory 8192
docker-machine start
~~~

## Makefile

- [GNU make manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html)
- [Makefile basics from Isaacs](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/62a2d1825d04437c6f08).

- [Automatic variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html#Automatic-Variables)
    - `$@` the target
    - `$<` the first prerequisite
    - `$^` all prerequisites
    - `$(@D)` the directory part of `$@` (works the same with `<`,`^`, etc).
    - `$(@F)` the filename part of `$@` (works the same with `<`,`^`, etc).
- [File name functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/File-Name-Functions.html#File-Name-Functions)
    - `$(notdir src/foo.c)` returns *foo.c*.
    - `$(addsuffix .c,foo)` returns *foo.c*.
    - `$(basename dir/foo.test.c)` returns *dir/foo.test*.
    - `objects := $(wildcard *.o)` to list files in a variable.
- [String functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html#Text-Functions)
    - `$(patsubst %.c,%.o,file.c)` to substitute file extensions
    - `$(subst from,to,text)` replaces all occurrences of *from* to *to* in *text*.
    - `$(word n,text)` returns the n-th word in *text*.
- Shell function: `$(shell cat foo)` runs a shell command.

## For file conversion

### Misc

- SVG to PDF: `inkscape --file=in.svg --export-area-drawing --without-gui --export-pdf=out.pdf`
- Video to mp3: `ffmpeg -i in.m4a -acodec mp3 -ac 2 -ab 192k out.mp3`
- HTML page to PDF: `pandoc -o out.pdf --include-in-header h.tex URL` where *h.tex* could contain LaTeX packages declarations like `\usepackage{fullpage}`.

### PDF 

#### to EPS

I ended up using Inkscape in command-line mode. The result is not so bad (better than the `pdf2eps` etc).

~~~sh
inkscape document.pdf --export-eps=document.eps
~~~

[Apparently](http://blm.io/blog/convert-pdf-eps-osx/), `pdftops` is even better.

~~~sh
pdftops -eps document.pdf
~~~

#### to PDF/A

In the end I had to use Acrobat Reader Pro...
Still, converting the PDF using the following commands beforehand helped (otherwise Acrobat Reader Pro couldn't convert it):

~~~sh
gs -dPDFA=1 -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -dEmbedAllFonts=true -dSubsetFonts=false -dHaveTrueTypes=true -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -sProcessColorModel=DeviceRGB -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sPDFACompatibilityPolicy=1 -sOutputFile=mainPDFA.pdf main.pdf
~~~

On the other hand, passing by a `.ps` stage as recommended [here](https://superuser.com/questions/188953/how-to-convert-a-pdf-to-a-pdf-a), produced a smaller PDF that was directly PDF/A compliant (no need for Acrobat Reader Pro) but lost all cross-reference links :(

~~~sh
pdftops main.pdf main.ps
gs -dPDFA -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -dNOOUTERSAVE -dUseCIEColor -sProcessColorModel=DeviceCMYK -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sPDFACompatibilityPolicy=1 -sOutputFile=mainPDFA.pdf main.ps
~~~

To check for PDF/A compliance I used [this online validator](https://www.pdf-online.com/osa/validate.aspx) or Acrobat Reader Pro.
Another way to check for problems is to look at the *emb* column of `pdffonts main.pdf` (should be all embedded) and the *type* column of `pdfimages -list main.pdf` (should be all *image*).

*Note: this is based only on my one-time experience with the PDF of my thesis.*
