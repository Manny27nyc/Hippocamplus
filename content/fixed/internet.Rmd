## DuckDuckGo

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/about) is a "search engine that doesn't track you". 
It provides nice "bangs" to search directly specific websites. 
By making DDG the default search engine these bangs can be used directly in the address bar.

- `!pub` PubMed.
- `!scholar` Google Scholar.
- `!bioc` Bioconductor.
- `!so` Stack Overflow.
- `!git` GitHub.
- `!w` Wikipedia.
- `!syn` synonyms from thesaurus.com.
- `!tz` Time Zone, time in other places.
- `!dgi` DuckDuckGo Images.
- `!i` Google Images.
- `!imd` IMDb.
- `!marmiton` Marmiton.
- `!map` Google Maps.
- `!wref`/`wrfe` Word Reference English to French (et vice versa).
- `!gtfr` Google Translate to French.
- `!gten` Google Translate to English.

## Ubuntu

I'm using [Ubuntu Gnome 16.04](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOME/GetUbuntuGNOME). 

+ I followed some of the steps [there](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/04/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-16-04-lts) to install essential packages.
+ To enable the use of my existing DSA SSH keys I did: 

`echo "PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss" >> ~/.ssh/config`

+ To force the second screen to follow the workspace of the primary screen I found [this](http://gregcor.com/2011/05/07/fix-dual-monitors-in-gnome-3-aka-my-workspaces-are-broken/): 

`gsettings set org.gnome.shell.overrides workspaces-only-on-primary false`

## Sync a specific Google Drive folder on Ubuntu

I use *grive* and followed [these instructions](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/sync-documents-with-google-drive-on-ubuntu-linux/).

To install:

```sh
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install grive
```

To configure in a directory DIR, syncing the Drive folder "ArticlesPDF":

```sh 
cd DIR
grive -a -s ArticlesPDF
```

In the future just sync by running the following command (in the DIR folder):

```sh
grive -s ArticlesPDF
```

*I usually try with the `--dry-run` option first because there are some glitches sometimes.*

Since very recently (~Nov 2019) another step is necessary:

1. Create a API key on [https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library) following [those instructions](https://github.com/vitalif/grive2/issues/287#issuecomment-559814555).
2. Run with `grive -s zotero-library --id "<ID.apps.googleusercontent.com>" --secret "<SECRET>"` (eventually add `-a` to configure).

## Sync PDFs between Mendeley and Google Drive

See [this post](/2018/09/22/sync-mendeley/).
*Edit: I switched to a "Zotero + Google Drive" solution, see below.*

## Zotero

Mostly following [this blog post](https://ikashnitsky.github.io/2019/zotero/).

In the general settings of Zotero I also specify the Google Drive folder as *base directory* and swich off the *Sync full-text content*.

Then using the [Zotfile](http://zotfile.com/) plugins to make sure the PDF files are consistent between computers.
The configuration I use is:

- Pointing at the Google Drive folder, with subfolders by authors `/%a`.
- Chaning to lower case and replacing blanks in file names.

For the [Better BibTeX plugin](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/), the most important setting is the citation key style: `[auth:lower][year][journal:lower:abbr]`.

I use [FolderSync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.lite&hl=en_US) to sync the PDFs that I annotate on my Android tablet.
I rarely need to manage/explore my library on my Android device (I usually just sync then read/annotate the most recent PDFs), but when I do I use the [ZotDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=computer.benjamin.zotdr0id&hl=en_US) app. 
Not great but the best I could find.

## Dowload files from Dropbox

By replacing `https://www.dropbox.com` with `https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com` in the link, a file can be dowloaded using command lines tools (e.g. wget or *download.file* in R).
It's useful to host files that are used in scripts, like some of the post I made using R-Markdown.

Originally it was useful to "serve" HTML pages but it doesn't work anymore.
