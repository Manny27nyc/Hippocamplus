## DuckDuckGo

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/about) is a "search engine that doesn't track you". 
It provides nice "bangs" to search directly specific websites. 
By making DDG the default search engine these bangs can be used directly in the address bar.

- `!pub` PubMed.
- `!scholar` Google Scholar.
- `!bioc` Bioconductor.
- `!so` Stack Overflow.
- `!git` GitHub.
- `!w` Wikipedia.
- `!syn` synonyms from thesaurus.com.
- `!tz` Time Zone, time in other places.
- `!dgi` DuckDuckGo Images.
- `!i` Google Images.
- `!imd` IMDb.
- `!marmiton` Marmiton.
- `!map` Google Maps.

## Ubuntu

I'm using [Ubuntu Gnome 16.04](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOME/GetUbuntuGNOME). 

+ I followed some of the steps [there](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/04/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-16-04-lts) to install essential packages.
+ To enable the use of my existing DSA SSH keys I did: 

`echo "PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss" >> ~/.ssh/config`

+ To force the second screen to follow the workspace of the primary screen I found [this](http://gregcor.com/2011/05/07/fix-dual-monitors-in-gnome-3-aka-my-workspaces-are-broken/): 

`gsettings set org.gnome.shell.overrides workspaces-only-on-primary false`

## Sync a specific Google Drive folder on Ubuntu

I use *grive* and followed [these instructions](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/sync-documents-with-google-drive-on-ubuntu-linux/).

To install:

```sh
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install grive
```

To configure in a directory DIR, syncing the Drive folder "ArticlesPDF":

```sh 
cd DIR
grive -a -s ArticlesPDF
```

In the future just sync by running the following command (in the DIR folder):

```sh
grive -s ArticlesPDF
```

*I usually try with the `--dry-run` option first because there are some glitches sometimes.*

## Sync PDFs between Mendeley and Google Drive

See [this post](/2018/09/22/sync-mendeley/).

## Host HTML documents in Dropbox

HTML reports are a convenient to send results to collaborators. They are easy to produce with R Markdown for example. When a HTML file is shared in [Dropbox](www.dropbox.com) the browser doesn't directly display its content but proposes the user to download the page. It's OK but it's another step for the collaborator to access the report.

To directly see the HTML page, the hack is to transform the link by replacing `https://www.dropbox.com` with `https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com`. 

*Edit: I don't think it works anymore*
