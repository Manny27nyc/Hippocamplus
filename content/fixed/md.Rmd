## Tips

+ `/` to add some vertical space/break.

## Converting Markdown into nice HTML pages

I use RMarkdown. It creates a self-contained HTML document that's looks nice enough and is easy to share.

~~~sh
Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("document.md")'
~~~

## Converting Markdown into slides

I use [MarkdownSlides](https://github.com/asanzdiego/markdownslides).

## Jekyll websites

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) websites are simple Markdown documents that can be converted into a website. [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) uses it to provide a website for a repo.

### Themes

There are several themes [available](http://jekyllthemes.org/). My favorite are the two [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) themes, Hyde and Lanyon.

### Table of Contents

`kramdown` automatically creates TOC if it sees :

~~~markdown
* Is replaced by the TOC
{toc}
~~~

To make it a bit nicer I created a `toc.html` file in the `_include` folder with:

~~~html
<nav>
  <h4>Table of Contents</h4>
  * TOC
  {:toc}
</nav>
~~~

Then I call the TOC in each markdown document using (without the `\`):

~~~markdown
\{\% include toc.html \%\}
~~~


### Math formulas

I use [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/mathjax.html) JavaScript display engine. I added to the *head* of the pages:

~~~html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" ></script>
~~~

Then inline formulas are defined by `\\(...\\)` (for equations, use `\\[...\\]`), and they follow [LaTeX syntax](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics).

For example, `\\(\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}\mathrm{d}x = \sqrt{\pi}\\)` produces $\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}\mathrm{d}x = \sqrt{\pi}$.


## blogdown websites

[blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) is a R package extending [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to build [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static websites.
Hugo is easier to install than Jekyll and apparently fast. Most importantly blogdown makes it easier to write posts with R code like in a RMarkdown document.

I still use GitHub Pages to deploy the website. Because GH Pages doesn't support Hugo, I build the website in a `docs` folder (`publishDir = "docs"` in `config.toml`) which I set up in the website settings to be the source of the static website. 

### Themes

There are several themes [available](https://themes.gohugo.io/). I keep using the [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) themes, Hyde and Lanyon, that have been [made available for Hugo](https://github.com/tummychow/lanyon-hugo).

### Table of Contents

In the YAML header of a page:

~~~yaml
output:
  blogdown::html_page:
    toc: true
~~~


### Math formulas

Using [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/mathjax.html) JavaScript display engine, I followed the instruction in the [blogdown documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/templates.html#how-to) and added to the footer partial:

~~~html
<script src="//yihui.name/js/math-code.js"></script>
<script async src="//cdn.bootcss.com/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script>
~~~

Then inline formulas are surronded by \$ (for equations use two \$), and they follow [LaTeX syntax](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics).
