### Colors in `less`

Use the `-r` or `-R` option. Sometimes the previous command needs a parameter make sure the output includes color codes.

~~~sh
tree -C | less -R
ls --color | less -R
grep --color=always | less -R
~~~

### Avoid killing ssh jobs

`nohup` function (apparently).

### rsync

`rsync` is not completely intuitive to me. 
Hera some of the commands I could make work.

--- 

To recurrently sync all the files that match the patterns in `rsyncIncludes.txt`:

~~~sh
rsync -r --include='*/' --include-from=rsyncIncludes.txt --exclude='*' --prune-empty-dirs SRC DEST
~~~

---

To recurrently sync all the files that match the patterns in `rsyncIncludes.txt` EXCEPT some with a specific pattern.
Practical example: all the R scripts but not the ones created by BatchJobs in `*-files` directories:

~~~sh
rsync -r --exclude="*-files" --include='*/' --include='*.R' --exclude='*' --prune-empty-dirs SRC DEST
~~~


### Mount server in OSX

I created a directory `sftp` (I don't know why I choose this name...anyway) and mount the root of the different servers there. Eventually I created a symbolic link at the root of my computer to point there so that paths like `/gs/projects/...` work directly, as if in the cluster.

To mount a server I use the following command:

~~~sh
sshfs jmonlong@guillimin.hpc.mcgill.ca:/ /Users/jeanmonlong/sftp/guillimin -ovolname=NAME
~~~

## One-liners

### Add headers with cat

`cat file.txt | cat headers.txt -` concatenated end of the pipe after `headers.txt`.

### Remove empty directories

`find . -type d | xargs rmdir`

### Perl one-liners

Inspired from these: [Catonmat](http://www.catonmat.net/blog/introduction-to-perl-one-liners/), [Ksplice](https://blogs.oracle.com/ksplice/the-top-10-tricks-of-perl-one-liners)

- `-p` run command on each line and print line.
- `-n` run command on each line but don't print line.
- `-i` operates on the file in-place, i.e. updating the input file.
- `-a` split the lines by white spaces into a `@F` array (`-F` to choose the separator)
- `-l` removes the trailing new line, and adds it back if `-p` is used.
- `$_` contains the line.
- `$.` contains the line number.

- Replace text line-by-line in a file: `perl -pe 's/you/me/g'`
- Replace text if line contains *foo*: `perl -pe 's/you/me/g if /foo/`
- Replace text line-by-line with regexp: `perl -pe 's/ID(\d+)/$1/g'`
- Operations on a CSV file: `perl -F, -ane 'print $F[3]+$F[8]`
- Operations on a CSV file and print at the end: `perl -F, -ane $t+=$F[3]+$F[8]; END{print $t}`
- Print matches from regular expression: `perl -ne 'print "$1\n" if /foo=([^;]*)/'`

## Shell scripting

Start a script with one of the [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29)

~~~sh
#!/bin/sh
~~~

### Variables

To remove a specific prefix/suffix from a variable name:

~~~sh
foo=${foop#$prefix}
foo=${foos%$suffix}
~~~

### If Then Else

A simple example:

~~~sh
if [ $VAL == "YEP" ]; then
	echo "It's a yes!"
else
	echo "No no no :("
fi
~~~

Or with multiple conditions:

~~~sh
if [ $VAL == "YEP" ] && [ COND ]; then
	echo "It's a yes!"
else
	echo "No no no :("
fi
~~~

The spacing is quite important, and the conditions can be built with:

+ `-eq` equal to.
+ `-ne` not equal to.
+ `-lt` less than.
+ `-le` less or equal than.
+ `-gt` great than.
+ `-ge` great or equal than.
+ `-s` file exists and not empty.
+ `-f` file exists and not directory.
+ `-d` directory exists.
+ `-x` file executable.
+ `-w` file writable.
+ `-r` file readable.


## Converting PDF into EPS

I ended up using Inkscape in command-line mode. The result is not so bad (better than the `pdf2eps` etc).

~~~sh
inkscape document.pdf --export-eps=document.eps
~~~

[Apparently](http://blm.io/blog/convert-pdf-eps-osx/), `pdftops` is even better.

~~~sh
pdftops -eps document.pdf
~~~

## Git

+ Commit all modification and added files: `git commit -am "informative message"`
+ To show all the history of a file: `git log -p -- file`.
+ To retrieve a specific version of a file: `git show COMMIT:file`.

#### Aliases

~~~sh
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.br branch
~~~


#### Branches

+ List branches: `git branch`
+ List all branches: `git branch -a`
+ Update remote branch list: `git remote prune origin`
+ Create branch: `git checkout -b hotfix`
+ Link it to a remote branch: `git branch -u origin/hotflix`
+ Creat a new local branch from remote: `git co -t origin/hotfix`
+ Merge the current branch with another branch: `git merge hotfix`
+ Delete a branch: `git branch -d hotfix`
+ Delete remote branch: `git push origin :hotfix`


## Docker cheatsheet

I'm still learning Docker but here are commands/parameters that seem relevant for me:

#### Build a docker instance

[Write a Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/) :

+ `WORKDIR /root` sets the working directory.
+ `COPY PopSV_1.0.tar.gz ./` copies a file in the instance. The `/` is important !
+ There is a cache management system so it's important to keep related commands in the same `RUN`.

To run in the folder with the `Dockerfile`.

~~~sh
docker build -t jmonlong/popsv-docker .
~~~

#### Launch a docker instance

To launch an interactive instance with a shared folder:

~~~sh
docker run -t -i -v /home/ubuntu/analysis1:/root/analysis1 jmonlong/popsv-docker
~~~

+ `-t` and `-i` are used for interactive run.
+ `-v` links folder in the host with folder in the image. It must be **absolute paths*.

#### Increase memory

In Mac OS, I had some problems with the docker stopping because of memory issues.
I fixed by changing:

~~~sh
docker-machine stop
VBoxManage modifyvm default --cpus 3
VBoxManage modifyvm default --memory 8192
docker-machine start
~~~
