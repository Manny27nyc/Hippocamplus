I use Emacs for almost everything: **coding, writing, taking notes, preparing presentations**. I'm using it right now ! Well I mean, at the time I'm writing this. There is also a good chance I'm using it now *now*.

## Basic configuration

Some of the basic tweaks on my `.emacs` file:

+ Disable startup screen with `(setq inhibit-splash-screen t)`.
+ Turn the blinking off with `(blink-cursor-mode 0)`.
+ Turn off the tool bar with `(tool-bar-mode 0)`.
+ Change the font with `(set-default-font "DejaVu Sans Mono 12")`.

## General commands

+ Counting words: select a region and press `M-=`. There are other ways for LaTeX.
+ In a console (R, Shell), previous/next line in the history is accessed by `M-p`/`M-n`. (Useful when ssh-tunneling with broken key-bindings).
+ Search for a regular expression in files using `M-x lgrep` command.

Regexp replace :

+ Command: `C-M-%`.
+ `\(` and `\)` to define groups.
+ `\1` to refer to the first group.

### Console-size split screen

I put this function and key binding in my `.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(defun consoleSplit ()
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (split-window-below)
    (enlarge-window 15)))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x 9") 'consoleSplit)
~~~

It splits the buffer in two and reduce the bottom buffer by 15 lines resulting in a large and a small buffer for example for a script and the console.

## MELPA package repository

Usually packages are just `.el` files to download and add in the folder defined in `.emacs` (e.g. `(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")`). However, there is easier way: [MELPA](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MELPA) package manager !

To install it, add to `.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
~~~

Then to find and install a new package, use `M-x list-packages`, find the package in the list and click on *Install*.

## Solarized theme

I use [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme palette. I installed the *color-theme-sanityinc-solarized* pacakge directly from [MELPA](#melpa-package-repository). I added the dark version as default with `(load-theme 'sanityinc-solarized-dark t)`. To change it interactively I run `M-x load-theme` and then for example `sanityinc-solarized-light`.


## For R

### Emacs Speaks Statistics

ESS can be installed through **MELPA**. Otherwise, see below.

To install ESS, without needing the admin rights, the easiest way is to download and compile it in a dedicated folder (e.g. `.emacs.d/lisp/ess`):

~~~sh
git clone https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS.git .emacs.d/lisp/ess
cd .emacs.d/lisp/ess
make
~~~

Then add these lines to `~/.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/ess/lisp/")
(load "ess-site")
~~~

### Auto-complete

To get auto-completion (with objects, functions or parameters) I use *auto-complete*. It's also available through MELPA.

Then I configure it in my `.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(require 'auto-complete-config)
(add-to-list 'ac-dictionary-directories "~/.emacs.d/lisp/ac-dict")
(ac-config-default)
(setq ac-auto-start nil)
(define-key ac-mode-map [C-tab] 'auto-complete)
(define-key ac-completing-map "\t" 'ac-complete)
(define-key ac-completing-map "\r" nil)
(setq ac-quick-help-delay 0.1)
~~~


### Smart underscores
By default, pressing underscore will insert a ` <- ` instead of a `_`. This was supposed to ease the pain of writing assignments with the arrow. However now we want a `_` most of the time (e.g. for *ggplot2* functions). Using smart underscore, ` <- ` will be inserted only when following a space.

Available in **MELPA**. Otherwise simply put [this *.el* file](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/ess-smart-underscore.el) in the load path and add these lines to `~/.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(require 'ess-smart-underscore)
(setq ess-S-underscore-when-last-character-is-a-space t)
~~~

### Poly-mode for R + Markdown

With polymode (MELPA), the mode depends on the position of the cursor in the document. For R + Markdown it means that we can edit the Markdown part in the markdown-mode and run the R code as if in a R script.

I added this to my `.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(require 'poly-R)
(require 'poly-markdown)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.Rmd\\'" . poly-markdown+r-mode))
~~~

### Keyboard shortcut to render RMarkdown

I [tweaked](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/ess-help/2004-September/002092.html) a function to run `rmarkdown::render` on the current buffer and I created a shortcut for it.

In `.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(defun renderRmd ()
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (message "Rendering %S" (buffer-file-name))
    (setq ess-command (format "rmarkdown::render(%S)" (buffer-file-name)))
    (ess-execute ess-command 'buffer nil nil)))
(add-hook 'ess-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (local-set-key (kbd "C-c C-d C-r") 'renderRmd)))
~~~

## For writing

### Spell checking

I use *ispell* and *flyspell*.

To turn on automatically the live spell check for Latex and markdown documents:

~~~lisp
(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)
(add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)
~~~

I use the *american* dictionary by default:

~~~lisp
(setq ispell-dictionary "american")
(setq ispell-local-dictionary "american")
~~~

### Thesaurus and synonyms

I use the `synonyms` package available in MELPA.
It's not as user friendly as some online resources but a good off-line alternative.
I downloaded the Gutenberg thesaurus [here](https://archive.org/download/mobythesauruslis03202gut/mthesaur.txt).
In my `.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(setq synonyms-file "/Users/jeanmonlong/.emacs.d/mthesaur.txt")
(setq synonyms-cache-file "/Users/jeanmonlong/.emacs.d/synonyms.cache")
(require 'synonyms)
~~~

### Grammar checking

Apparently `langtool` package available in MELPA.
In my `.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(require 'langtool)
(setq langtool-language-tool-jar "/usr/local/Cellar/languagetool/3.8/libexec/languagetool-commandline.jar")
(setq langtool-default-language "en-US")
(setq langtool-mother-tongue "fr")
(setq langtool-disabled-rules '("MORFOLOGIK_RULE_EN_US"))
~~~

Then:

- `M-x langtool-check` to highlight problems.
- `M-x langtool-check-done` to stop.

## For LaTeX

I put some Emacs tricks (e.g. for table manipulation) on the [LaTeX page](https://jmonlong.github.io/Hippocamplus/latex).

I general I prefer to use AUCTeX (available through MELPA).
It handles multi-file documents and keeps the annoying compilation buffer closed.
My configuration is:

~~~lisp
(setq TeX-PDF-mode t)
(setq-default TeX-master nil)
(setq LaTeX-verbatim-environments-local '("lstlisting"))
~~~


### Word count

I found a wrapper around `texcount` that count the number of words in a document. It can be called with `M-x latex-word-count` after adding this to your `.emacs` configuration:

~~~lisp
(defun latex-word-count ()
 (interactive)
  (let* ((this-file (buffer-file-name))
     (word-count
      (with-output-to-string
        (with-current-buffer standard-output
          (call-process "texcount" nil t nil "-inc" "-brief" this-file)))))
(string-match "\n$" word-count)
(message (replace-match "" nil nil word-count))))
~~~

I would like to add a feature to this: counting selected text.

### Chunk folding

Sometimes I like to fold chunk of the document to improve clarity, e.g. frames in beamer document or figure/table in a manuscript.
I added to my `.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook (lambda ()
			     (add-to-list 'LaTeX-fold-env-spec-list '("[frame]" ("frame")))
			     (setq TeX-fold-macro-spec-list (list ()))
			     (TeX-fold-mode 1)))
~~~

Then the main key bindings are:

- `C-c C-o C-e` folds an environment.
- `C-c C-o C-r` folds a region.
- `C-c C-o i` unfold an item.
- `C-c C-o C-f` to switch the fold-mode on/off

Because I added *frame* in the list, I can select a bunch of frames, press `C-c C-o C-r` and they all get folded (but not the rest).
Otherwise, I manually fold the frames/figures/tables that are distracting.

## For Markdown

- `C-c C-s s` **bold** (**s**trong).
- `C-c C-s e` *italic* (**e**mphasis).
- `C-c C-s s` `code` (**c**ode).
- `C-c C-o` follow a link.
- `C-c C-x C-l` to toggle the *hide-url* mode to get shorter links.


### Table formatting

Pressing `TAB` when the cursor is in a heading will cycle through *heading-only/full* view.

`M-x orgtbl-mode` to format markdown tables.

### Markdown live preview

[`markdown-preview-mode`](https://github.com/ancane/markdown-preview-mode) opens a page on the web browser and update it every time the buffer is saved.


## For Python
	
### Elpy python mode
[Elpy](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy) combines several packages to provide a lot of nice features, e.g. code coloring, completion, syntax checks, formatting recommendations.

To install, follow instructions on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy) and add to `.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(package-initialize)
(elpy-enable)
~~~

### Add some key bindings
I added key bindings to send regions or the entire buffer to the opened Python shell. In `.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'my-python)
(defun my-python ()
  (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-c r") 'python-shell-send-region)
  (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-c b") 'python-shell-send-buffer))
~~~

### Send commands to a specific buffer

Sometimes I want to send the commands to a specific buffer. For example, when testing new packages within a Docker container, I start a *shell* buffer, run docker and python.

I installed *isend* from MELPA. Then I simply go to the *code* buffer and run `M-x isend-associate RET *shell* RET`. At this point `C-Enter` will send the command to the *shell* buffer.

## For Shell

To open a *shell* buffer, type `M-x shell`.

Then I use the [*Emacs Speaks SHELL*](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/essh) package, that adds all the nice commands to send lines/regions from a script to a Shell buffer. In my `.emacs` I added:

~~~lisp
(require 'essh)
(defun essh-sh-hook ()
  (define-key sh-mode-map "\C-c\C-r" 'pipe-region-to-shell)
  (define-key sh-mode-map "\C-c\C-b" 'pipe-buffer-to-shell)
  (define-key sh-mode-map "\C-c\C-j" 'pipe-line-to-shell)
  (define-key sh-mode-map "\C-c\C-n" 'pipe-line-to-shell-and-step)
  (define-key sh-mode-map "\C-c\C-f" 'pipe-function-to-shell)
  (define-key sh-mode-map "\C-c\C-d" 'shell-cd-current-directory))
(add-hook 'sh-mode-hook 'essh-sh-hook)
~~~

The shortcuts are self-explanatory.


## For file manipulation

To compare and merge two files, use Ediff mode by calling `M-x ediff` (or `M-x ediff-buffers` when *diff* should be done between existing buffers). Once launched press:

+ `|` to change the split mode (vertical/horizontal).
+ `n`/`p` to go to the next/previous difference.
+ `a` to put A's version to B.
+ `b` to put B's version to A.
+ `q` to quit.
+ `?` to get the full list of shortcuts.

To visualize blanks (tabs, spaces, new lines) I use the minor mode `whitespace-mode`.

### CSV/TSV

I use the `csv-mode` and the command `c-c c-a` to align columns.
By default it understand `,`, `;` and `\t` as separator.
If not I think the variable to customize is `csv-separators`.

### Dired mode

When opening a directory (`C-x C-f`), Emacs shows the files in Dired mode:

- `d`/`u` mark/unmark files for deletion.
- `x` deletes files marked for deletion.
- `% d regexp <RET>` flags file matching a regexp.
- `R` rename a file.
- `C` copy a file.

## For Version Control

The built-in interface supports Git:

+ `C-x v +` to pull.
+ `C-x v d` to show the status.
+ `C-x v v` to commit.
+ `C-x v P` to push.
+ `C-x v i` to add.
+ `C-x v =` to see differences.

A more popular Git interface is [Magit](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Magit).

## For online notes

### Evernote

I use [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) for easily keep notes synchronized across computer, tablet and smartphone. And there is a [Emacs mode for it](https://github.com/pymander/evernote-mode) (of course!).

To install it, first run:

~~~sh
gem install evernote_oauth
git clone https://github.com/pymander/evernote-mode
cd evernote-mode/ruby
ruby setup.rb
~~~

I had an error with the last command and fixed it by changing `::Config::CONFIG` with `::RbConfig::CONFIG` in `setup.rb`.

Then, copy `evernote-mode.el` to the load path and add to `.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(require 'evernote-mode)
(setq evernote-developer-token "<MYTOKEN>")
(setq evernote-username "<MYUSERNAME>")
(setq evernote-enml-formatter-command '("w3m" "-dump" "-I" "UTF8" "-O" "UTF8"))
(global-set-key "\C-cec" 'evernote-create-note)
(global-set-key "\C-ceo" 'evernote-open-note)
(global-set-key "\C-ces" 'evernote-search-notes)
(global-set-key "\C-ceS" 'evernote-do-saved-search)
(global-set-key "\C-cew" 'evernote-write-note)
(global-set-key "\C-cep" 'evernote-post-region)
(global-set-key "\C-ceb" 'evernote-browser)
~~~

I retrieved my developer token (to use instead of `<MYTOKEN>`) [there](https://www.evernote.com/api/DeveloperToken.action).

Side notes:

1. I also had to install *w3m* software.
2. By default the notes are in read-only XHTML mode, I use `M-x evernote-change-edit-mode TEXT` to change the edit mode to text.

### Simplenote

I now use [Simplenote](https://app.simplenote.com/) instead of Evernote, in order to make sure that I have an offline version of my notes at all time. Moreover it integrates (almost completely) the Markdown format. It makes it easy to take notes and to transfer them in our wiki (e.g. for conference notes). It's also easier to clean the notes through emacs compared to the online page or apps.

There is a [Emacs package](https://github.com/alpha22jp/simplenote2.el) that can be installed using MELPA: `M-x package-install [RET] simplenote2 [RET]`.

The Simplenote buffer can be summoned by `M-x simplenote2-browse` or `M-x simplenote2-list`.

In list mode, the relevant commands are:

- `g`: sync with the server.
- `a`: create a new note
- `d`: mark note on the current line for deletion
- `u`: unmark note on the current line for deletion
- `t`: set tags for filtering
- `^`: toggle tags filtering condition between "AND" and "OR"

Other general commands include:

- `simplenote2-add-tag` and `simplenote2-delete-tag`
- `simplenote2-set-markdown`


## File encryption

Encryption is integrated directly. Just add the extension `.gpg` to a file.


## For OSX

Here are some bits of configuration specific to OSX.

### Maximize window at opening

Using the *maxframe* elisp from [Ryan McGeary](https://github.com/rmm5t/maxframe.el). I'll copy the `maxframe.el` in the *master* branch of this repo in case it disappears.

~~~lisp
(require 'maxframe)
(add-hook 'window-setup-hook 'maximize-frame t)
~~~

### Keybindings

To change the annoying OSX bindings: paragraph jumping, home/end for line not page.

~~~lisp
(define-key function-key-map (kbd "M-<down>") 'forward-paragraph)
(define-key function-key-map (kbd "M-<up>") 'backward-paragraph)
(global-set-key (kbd "<home>") 'beginning-of-line)
(global-set-key (kbd "<end>") 'end-of-line)
~~~

### Ispell

To specify where is *ispell* located.

~~~lisp
(setq ispell-program-name "/usr/local/Cellar/ispell/3.4.00/bin/ispell")
~~~

Also something about the right-click (I don't remember why I have that).

~~~lisp
(eval-after-load "flyspell"
    '(progn
       (define-key flyspell-mouse-map [down-mouse-3] #'flyspell-correct-word)
       (define-key flyspell-mouse-map [mouse-3] #'undefined)))
~~~

	
### Explicit path definition

For LaTeX, I specified the *PATH* in `.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(setenv "PATH" (concat (getenv "PATH") ":/usr/texbin"))
(setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/usr/texbin")))
~~~

For pandoc and ESS, I defined a *RSTUDIO_PANDOC* in `.emacs`:

~~~lisp
(setenv "RSTUDIO_PANDOCPATH" (concat (getenv "RSTUDIO_PANDOC") ":/usr/local/bin"))
~~~
